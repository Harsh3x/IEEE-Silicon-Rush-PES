# Calorie Counter with Image Classification

This repository contains the implementation of an innovative **Calorie Counter**, a project developed to promote healthier eating habits. It leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based image classification model** to analyze food items and provide insights on calorie content. The system tracks daily calorie intake, awards points for healthy choices, and allows users to redeem these points for coupons, making healthy eating both rewarding and engaging.

## üìã Features

### 1. **Image-Based Calorie Estimation**
- Users can upload pictures of their meals.  
- A **CNN-based image classification model** identifies the food items in the image and estimates their calorie content.

### 2. **Health and Reward System**
- The system evaluates the nutritional value of food and categorizes it as "healthy" or "unhealthy."  
- Points are awarded for consuming healthy foods.

### 3. **Redeemable Rewards**
- Accumulated points can be exchanged for exciting coupons, motivating users to make healthier choices.

### 4. **Daily Calorie Tracking**
- The platform logs the calorie intake of users throughout the day.  
- A comprehensive view of daily consumption is provided, enabling better dietary management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

### **Frontend**
- Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to provide a clean, intuitive, and responsive user interface.  
- The frontend allows users to:
  - Upload food images.
  - View calorie and reward summaries.
  - Track daily progress.

### **Machine Learning Model**
- A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on a diverse dataset of food images.  
- The model:
  - Classifies food items from uploaded images.
  - Estimates the calorie content based on identified food categories.

### **Backend**
- Developed using **Node.js** and **Express.js** for a fast and scalable server-side architecture.  
- Handles:
  - Integration with the CNN model for image processing.
  - API endpoints for calorie tracking and reward management.

### **Database**
- Uses **MongoDB**, a NoSQL database, to manage and store:
  - User profiles.
  - Daily calorie logs.
  - Points and reward redemption history.
